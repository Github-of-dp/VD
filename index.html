            <p>They say people come into your life for a reason. With you, I didn't just find a reason—I found a home. Every conversation, every laugh, and every quiet moment we share is a memory I keep tucked away in my heart.</p>

                    <p>It wasn’t a lightning bolt; it was a slow, beautiful realization. One day I looked at you and realized that the world felt a little less chaotic when you were near. You have this magic in you that turns an ordinary day into something I never want to end.</p>
